                        <div id="dropdown5Content" class="dropdownContent"><p>The <a href="https://insider.thefdagroup.com/p/answering-a-few-faqs-about-navigating" target="_blank">510(k) process</a> is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective, and substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. The FDA typically reviews a traditional 510(k) within 90 days, though this timeline can extend if additional information is requested. Engaging with experienced consultants can help streamline this process and address any regulatory challenges.</p>
